	<p>This is some placeholder text while I figure out the rest of this assignment. Things I can mention in the real bio would include where I grew up, where I went to school, what I studied, what I do now, and what I want to learn.</p>
	<p>And for the second paragraph, I could talk about my other interests.. things like yoga, cycling, happy hour and b-horror films. A pretty decent portion should also be about Copper.</p>
